    "# Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle behind nearest neighbor is to find a predefined number of training samples closest in distance to the new data, and predict its label. The number of samples can be a user-defined-constant, or vary in the local density points (radius-based neighbor learning). This distance can be any metric, although standard Euclidean distance is the most popular choice. Neighbors-based methods are known as non-generalizing machine learning methods, since they don't create a model, but remember the training set. Neighbors-based classification is a type of instance-based learning or non-generalizing learning: it doesn't tries to construct a model, but simply stores instances of the training data. Classification is computed from a single majority vote of the nearest neighbors of each point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, nearest neighbors has been successfull in a large number of **classification and regression problems**. Being a non-parametric mehod, it is often **successful in classification situations where the decision boundary is very irregular**.\n"
