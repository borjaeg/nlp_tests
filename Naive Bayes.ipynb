    "# Naïve Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Naïve Bayes classifiers are a family of classifiers that are based on the popular Bayes' probability theorem. They are known for creating simple yet well performing models, especially in the fields of document classification and disease prediction. This type of classifier ir linear and are know for being very efficient. The adjective **naive** come from the assumption that the features in the dataset are **mutually independent**. More exactly the sampres should be *i.i.d* (indepentend and identically distributed). One exaple of this behaviour would be coin tossing. In practice, the independende assumption is often violated byu the classifier still tends to perform correctly. Especially for **small datasets** naive Bayes classifiers can outperform the more powerful alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong violations of the independence assumption and **non-linear classification problems** (instance based such as nearest neighbors would be better) can lead to very **poor performance**. In practice, it is always recommeded to compare different classification models on the particular dataset and consider the prediction performances as well as computational efficiency."

And since the evidence term is a constant, the decision rule will wntirely depend on the class-conditional probabilities. Eventually the **a priori knowledge** can be obtained by consulting a domain expert or by estimation from the training data."

    "\n",
    "Empirical comparisons provide evidence that the multinomial model tends to outperform the multi-variate Bernouilli model if the vocabulary size is large enough. However, the performance of machine learning algorighms is highly dependent on the appropriate choice of features. In this case, performance can be attributed to the choices of stop word removal, stemming, and token-length.\n",
