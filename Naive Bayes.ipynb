    "# Naïve Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Naïve Bayes classifiers are a family of classifiers that are based on the popular Bayes' probability theorem. They are known for creating simple yet well performing models, especially in the fields of document classification and disease prediction. This type of classifier ir linear and are know for being very efficient. The adjective **naive** come from the assumption that the features in the dataset are **mutually independent**. In practice, the independende assumption is often violated byu the classifier still tends to perform correctly. Especially for **small datasets** naive Bayes classifiers can outperform the more powerful alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong violations of the independence assumption and **non-linear classification problems** can lead to very **poor performance**. In practice, it is always recommeded to compare different classification models on the particular dataset and consider the prediction performances as well as computational efficiency.."
