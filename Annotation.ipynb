    "Annotaion refers to the process of adding metadata information to the text in order to augment a computer's capability to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP). This can be done through **machine learning algorithms**. The process of annotation **is not linear**, so it means that multiple iterations can be required for defining the tasks, and evaluations, in order to achieve the best results for a particular goal.\n",
